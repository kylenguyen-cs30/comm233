# Media Project 1

## Due Date : 03/12/2025

- For Media Project #1, students will be able to choose one of these four Media Project assignment options. Each item is worth
  25 points and requires you to engage in the production of some form of media, which you will upload to Canvas as a file.
  Important: DO NOT SEND ANY LINKS.

- My Media Journey—A Vlog: Edit together a 5-minute video diary in which you depict the various ways in which you have utilized
  media for one week in your life and daily routine. Include all experiences and exposure to media, if possible, including radio,
  video games, TV, films, recorded music, newspapers, magazines, books, online journalism, or broadcast journalism. Be thorough and
  descriptive. Narrate your journey over video clips you have shot that are edited together. Make it interesting and dynamic. This
  is a video about you, so make sure we can see you in the video at times. Export your video as an .MP4 or .MOV file. Upload your completed
  video file to Canvas. Video will be graded for completeness, depth, and adherence to instructions.

- Read and Critique—An Audio Response: Create a 5-minute audio “podcast” in which you provide your critique and opinion on one of
  the textbook’s “Examining Ethics” sections (see table of contents). Refer to the book’s discussion by paraphrasing what the book
  has mentioned in the section but avoid quoting the book directly. This assignment should be produced totally in your own words. Substantiate
  your claims, statements, and viewpoints by quoting articles and news sources that bolster your position. Export your audio as an .MP3
  file. Upload your completed audio file to Canvas. Audio will be graded for completeness, depth, and adherence to instructions.

- Working in the Media—A Professional Interview Video: Submit a 10-minute Q&A video of you interviewing someone who works
  professionally in the media industry. This can be accomplished by recording the video via Zoom or via your smartphone if it is
  in person. For the purposes of this assignment and the class, the "media industry" means they are full-time employees of a company
  that produces or develops digital media (like apps), radio, video games, TV programming, films, recorded music, newspapers, magazines,
  books, advertising, public relations, or broadcast journalism. Ask questions about their position, their educational and professional
  backgrounds, their current job duties, and the projects that they have worked on or are currently working on. MAKE SURE TO GET
  THE INTERVIEWEE’S PERMISSION BEFORE RECORDING THE VIDEO. Record the video in a quiet setting so we can clearly hear the
  interviewee (in other words, not at a coffee shop!). Include video of both yourself and the interviewee. Export
  your video as an .MP4 or .MOV file. Upload your completed video file to Canvas. Video will be graded for completeness, depth, and
  adherence to instructions.

- Media Literacy & the Critical Process—A Presentation: Using the textbook’s Critical Process steps as a foundation, develop a slideshow
  that examines a media product (e.g., a movie, a music album) or service (e.g., Hulu, Spotify) not discussed in the book via the Critical
  Process. The slideshow should contain at least 7 slides in the following order... Slide #1: a title slide, Slide #2: a summary of the
  media product/service under critique, and Slides #3-7: a slide for each of the 5 steps in the Critical Process. Make the slides visually
  interesting. Ensure that each slide is explanatory, yet do not pack the slides with text. (Be judicious in how you produce your slideshow.)
  Narrate the audio via Microsoft PowerPoint’s audio narration tools
  (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-presentation-2570dff5-f81c-40bc-b404-e04e95ffab33Links to an external site.) and test
  it afterwards to ensure playback works. Note that narration is not just reading what’s already written on the slides, but offers information
  well above and beyond the slides' content. Submit it as a PowerPoint (.PPT OR .PPTX) document only (not as a video file). Presentation will be graded for completeness, depth, and adherence to instructions.

- IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

- Media Project #1 is due on Wed., March 12 at 3 p.m. Late submissions are accepted with a penalty of 5% per hour late, starting at 3 p.m.
  (per the Canvas clock). Assignments are automatically checked for plagiarism via Canvas. The types of files you'll be uploading will be large
  and will take time to process, so please keep that in mind. Please NAME your file with the particular project that you are doing. Canvas will
  not accept any file uploads of more than 500MB per file; check your file size to ensure it is below this limit. You may have to re-export your
  file from your video editing software with a higher compression setting to achieve a smaller file size. Technical issues with uploading to Canvas,
  using your computer or using your device(s) are not reasons to request extensions for deadlines. Please complete this assignment well before the
  posted deadline to avoid last-minute problems.
